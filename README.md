# spring-boot-json-validation
Minimal example for spring boot behaviour of json validation

This example shows that it is possible to send a json message to a spring boot POST endpoint. 
The endpoint allows a json message with unknown properties in the message. The endpoint does not return with a 400 bad request as expected.
